# Dragino-MS14-S-Relay-Board

Darlington array 5V relay driver for the Dragino MS14-S. Plugs into the daughterboard header inside, provides high current 5V for driving motors, relays.

12V canâ€™t be done because the MS14 sensor output pins have 6V ESD protection on them (excess voltage shunted to GND).
